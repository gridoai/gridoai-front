    {
      "header": "Information We Collect",
      "body": "We collect only the information necessary to deliver our service: providing you with AI-powered responses. This includes any data you provide us, whether directly or through integrations with other platforms."
    },
    {
      "header": "How We Use Information We Collect",
      "body": "We strictly use your data to generate AI-based responses. We do not use it for any other purposes. We store your data in its original form along with its numerical representation (embedding) that is used for providing the AI services. This storage is to allow for future optimization of our services, should we find better ways of calculating embeddings."

      "header": "Data Storage and Anonymization",
      "body": "While we store your original data, we also implement a process called data anonymization. This means that we convert your data into a different format (an 'embedding') that can't be reversed or decoded. Although we retain the original data, the use of embeddings for our services provides an additional layer of security and privacy."
